IMDB_Review_Sentiment_Analysis

The dataset used here has 50K movie reviews fetched from the IMDB website. This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification. Our objective is to predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms like LSTM recurrent neural networks. We develop sequential LSTM neural network with embedding, spatial dropout, LSTM layers, and dense layers for sequence tasks, handling sequences of length 250 and utilizing around 5 million parameters.
